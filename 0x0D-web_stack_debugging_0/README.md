# Web Stack Debugging 0

In this project, we aim to debug and fix issues related to web stack configuration. The tasks involve getting Apache to run on a Docker container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of it.

## Task

### Task 0: Give me a page!

In this task, we need to configure Apache to return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of the Docker container. The provided Bash script (`0-give_me_a_page`) accomplishes this by installing Apache, starting the Apache service, and creating an HTML file with the required content.

## Directory Structure

- `0-give_me_a_page`: Bash script to configure Apache and return a page containing "Hello Holberton".
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its tasks.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error.
- Bash scripts must run without error.
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- All Bash script files must be executable.
- A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project folder.
